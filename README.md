# Reusable-caluclator
Reusable calculator in c sharp.
Unsure how to use either 'Yes' and 'yes' or 'No' and 'no' as valid answers so it must be case sensitive.
Only just started with the language. Have dabbled with other coding languages before though. 
If there is anything I can improve on please send me a DM on my discord or leave a message on this website.
